# User Registration System

This is a **User Registration System** built using **PHP**, which offers essential authentication functionalities such as **Sign Up, Log In, and Log Out**. The project ensures secure access management by handling user sessions and validating credentials, making it suitable for small-scale applications.

  - Passwords are hashed (optional) for security during authentication.

- **Log Out**: 
  - Users can securely log out, terminating their session and ensuring access to protected pages is restricted.

  - Active sessions are tracked to control access to private pages.

- **Form Validation**: 
  - Client-side and server-side validation for ensuring proper data input.

## Requirements
